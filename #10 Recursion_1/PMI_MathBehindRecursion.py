#0. f is true for all natural numbers & E(n) = {n(n+1)}/2

#1. take f(0), f(1) is true

#2. let f(K) is true

#3. Prove f(K+1) is true

# so.
#     take   :  E1 = 1(1+1)/2 = 1
#     assume :  Ek = k(k+1)/2
#     take   :  E(k+1) = (k+1)(K+1+1)/2

# so.  now   : E(k+1) = Ek + k+1                _______E(k+1) is basically : summation of (k) terms + (k+1)th term
#                   = k(k+1)/2 + K+1
#  or               = K+1(K+2)/2

#            Hence Proved
